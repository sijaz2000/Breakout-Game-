My first project built from scratch!
A breakout game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a paddle at the bottom of the screen to bounce a ball towards a wall of bricks. I created a simple version using Java 11.

## Lessons Learned

This project provided an introduction to Object-Oriented Programming, particularly the concept of encapsulation. It also allowed me to enhance my Java programming skills and gain confidence in Java development.

I was also able to learn a lot about Arrays. I had an opportunity to manipulate them, keep track of them, and perform other basic functions on it.


## Run Locally

- Clone the project

- Store it on your local machine in whichever folder you wish

- Open in any IDE (IntelliJ or VScode)

- Go to ```BreakoutGame.java``` in the ```src``` directory and go all the way down in the source code and click run on top of the ```main``` method.

- Use left and right arrow keys to move the paddle. You get three lives. Whether you manage to win or not, you'll get a "You Win!" or "You Lose!" message in your terminal.

- Enjoy!
